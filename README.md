# katt64.github.io

This is my personal website hosted on Github pages. It's just a website about me
and the stuff I have done. Here, you will find quintessential, and perhaps
trivial information about me, and you will find a few [sister
projects][systerproj] of this website that are too small to move out but too
large to chuck out.

So, feel free to browse around this repository or [the
website](https://katt64.github.io/) itself.
